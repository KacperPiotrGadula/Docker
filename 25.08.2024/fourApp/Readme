The wagoodman/dive tool is an open-source utility designed for analyzing Docker images. Its primary purpose is to help optimize Docker images by providing a detailed view of the image layers and identifying potential issues such as excessive unnecessary files or inefficient image builds.

Key Features of dive:
Layer Inspection: It allows you to inspect each layer of a Docker image, enabling you to understand what exactly happens at each step of the image build process.

Layer Size Analysis: Dive displays how much space each layer occupies, helping to identify layers that might be too large or contain unnecessary data.

Identification of Unnecessary Files: The tool can show which files were added, modified, or removed in each layer, making it easier to identify unnecessary files.

User-Friendly Interface: Dive offers an interactive terminal-based interface, making it easy to browse and analyze Docker images.

How to Use dive?
Installation: You can install dive on your local system or run it as a Docker container.

Local Installation

On Linux:
sudo apt-get install dive

On macOS (via Homebrew):
brew install dive

Running as a Docker Container.
You can run dive directly as a Docker container:

docker run --rm -it \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  wagoodman/dive:latest <image_name>

Analyzing an Image: After installing dive, you can analyze a specific image, e.g., dive myimage:latest, which opens an interactive interface where you can inspect image layers, check file sizes, and analyze build efficiency.

Example Usage:
If you have an image named myapp:latest, you can run dive as follows:

dive myapp:latest
