# Configure Docker Engine

Add conection to docker via API with use TCP connection

We need add new information in docker engine file (/etc/docker/daemon.json):

"hosts":["unix:///var/run/docker.sock","tcp://0.0.0.0:2375"]

{
  "builder": {
    "gc": {
      "defaultKeepStorage": "20GB",
      "enabled": true
    }
  },
  "experimental": false,
  "hosts":["unix:///var/run/docker.sock","tcp://0.0.0.0:2375"]
}

We need one more information add in file /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/docker.conf:

[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd

After that we should restart docker

sudo systemctl restart docker

Than we can try

docker container -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 ps

## !!! NOTE !!!!

Do not edit docker engine on windows, specifically on WLC 2

I.e. ubuntu console on windows

- if you edit it, it won't work anyway, you will only cause a conflict and docker dectop won't start up
- it will always stop
- once you have added the files, you must delete them
- then restart docker desctop
