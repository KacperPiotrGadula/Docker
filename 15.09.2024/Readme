# .env

Only add env to docker-compose file

Nothing this file change in DockerFile or command

# Weighted values for environment variables

Command > Dockerfile (set on hoscie) > .env

## Failed in docker-compose.yml:

validating C:"PATH"\docker-compose.envfile.yml: (root) Additional property service is not allowed

### Reason:

The YAML for docker-compose has a section called service, which is not correct in this context. In docker-compose.yml, the correct section is called services, not service

validating C:"PATH"\15.09.2024\docker-compose.yml: volumes must be a mapping

### Reason:

volumes:
  db_volume
  wordpress_volume

Should be:

volumes:
  db_volume:
  wordpress_volume:

## Use docker-compose file

docker compose -f .\docker-compose.envfile.yml down - delete containers created via docker-compose.yml file

docker compose -f .\docker-compose.envfile.yml up -g -> create 2 containers in new virtual deocker networking
