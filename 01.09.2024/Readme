Relevant information about images/containers

1) One Container = one service or aplication

2) SRP - Single responsibility principle

3) Don't lump frontend and backend into one container. Also, don't create one common image out of them. They are supposed to be two non-dependent images with two non-dependent later working containers. Take care of their communication

4) Don't put junk files in images

5) I should take care of the .dockerignore, in which I should include exclusions for
- .git
- node_modules
- !README*.md
- node_modules/
- Dockerfile
- .dockerignore

6) Dockerignore - this is nothing but a file where I exclude those resources that I don't want to be included in the later image

7) We should avoid using the tag :latest
