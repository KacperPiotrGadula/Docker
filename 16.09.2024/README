**Using the environment variables defined on the host on which docker is running, you can define several environments with a single docker compose**.

To achieve this you need to:

- define a port with what variable

``docker
ports:
      - ${WORDPRESS_PORT}:80
```

in the commandline of the host on which docker is running put in the environment variables:

- Windows Powershell: `$Env:WP_PORT=‘9091’`
- Linux: `export WP_PORT=9091`.

Define which project/stage for which project we want to run:

- dev
- test
- prod

then enter the docker compose **-p** parameter in the project start command

docker compose -f <file if not default> -p <project name> -d

docker-compose -p <project name> down -v

E.g.

docker compose -p test -d
docker compose -p test down -v
